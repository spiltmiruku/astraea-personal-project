          <p>
            In Greek mythology, ASTRAEA is the 'star-maiden', and the goddess of
            innocence.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            ASTRAEA is a lifestyle brand, and the future of travel, however, we
            are more than a space travel company. We create luxury experiences
            for our clientele. With choices like the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter,
            you can choose the ultimate travel destination.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At ASTRAEA, we provide the comfort of staying at a Ritz Carlton with
            the elegance of Hermes. Your journey into space will be smooth and
            punctual, because weâ€™ll keep time like a Vacheron Constantin watch.
