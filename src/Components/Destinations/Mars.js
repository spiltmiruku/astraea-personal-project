          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is the second smallest
          planet in the solar system. Named after the Roman god of war, Mars is
          also often described as the “Red Planet” due to its reddish
          appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere
          composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Mars has the largest dust storms
          in the solar system. They can last for months and cover the entire
          planet.

          NASA's Mars rover Opportunity (Oppy) got hit by a storm and it knocked
          the camera and wheels out, and her last words were "My battery is low
          and it is getting cold".
          <br />
          NASA tried to reach her for eight months, and as their final farewell,
          they played Billie Holiday's "I'll be seeting you".
